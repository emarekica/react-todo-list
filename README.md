## Improvements

<br>

[ ] Add check box next to each item to remove it >> doesn't remove it, but **strikes it**

[ ] add button to make a new list (reloads the page)

[x] add favicon

[x] check error modal CSS in queries

- smaller font in modal in mobile mode + make the container wider (horrible on Firefox)
- in mobile, the GOT IT button to exit the error modal is invisible + not working
- make error modal container not overlap with the input field

[ ] implement SCSS

[ ] Add [password validation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12090077/javascript-regular-expression-password-validation-having-special-characters)
